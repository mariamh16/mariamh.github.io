Hello! Iâ€™m a graduate student in clinical psychology at the University of Arizona. My research broadly focuses on memory and aging. I am co-mentored by [Matt Grilli](https://www.grillilab.com/) and [Jessica Andrews-Hanna](https://mindwindowapp.wixsite.com/my-site). Previously, I was a research assistant at Duke University working with [Simon Davis](https://sites.duke.edu/electricdino/). I completed my undergraduate at the University of California, Los Angeles.
